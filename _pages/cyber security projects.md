---

### 📝 Summary
**📌 Skills Demonstrated:**
- Network traffic analysis principles
- Tcpdump fundamentals
- Working with Wireshark
- Wireshark filterson

This module introduced me to packet analysis and traffic monitoring. I learned to capture, filter, and interpret network data using industry-standard tools. I also practiced applying filters, identifying protocol behaviors, and decrypting RDP sessions.

---

### 🔍 Key Practical Labs

#### 🧪 Tcpdump Fundamentals
- Captured traffic using `tcpdump -i eth0 -nvXc 100`
- Parsed `.pcap` files with hex/ASCII output via `-Xr`
- Applied filters like `host`, `port`, `not icmp`

#### 🕸️ Wireshark Traffic Analysis
- Used display filters (`http`, `dns`, `ftp-data`)
- Followed TCP streams to extract `Rise-Up.jpg`
- Identified malicious actor: **Bob**

#### 🔐 RDP Decryption & Threat Hunt
- Discovered suspicious RDP session by user: **Bucky**
- Found unauthorized user creation: **Hacker**
- Flagged suspicious port usage: `4444`

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- 💡 Stronger understanding of networking layers and protocols  
- 🧵 Traced sessions and reconstructed traffic streams  
- 🔎 Enhanced ability to recognize traffic anomalies  
- 🛡️ Strengthened foundation in network forensics

### 🔎 **DNS in Detail**  

🎯 **Platform**: [TryHackMe – DNS in Detail](https://tryhackme.com/room/dnsindetail)  
📚 **Module Summary**:  
Hands-on room focused on understanding DNS mechanics, hierarchy, and exploitation in cybersecurity contexts. Covered how DNS queries are made, record types used, and tools for enumeration and information gathering.

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- 🧪 `dig` – DNS query tool  
- 🧾 `nslookup` – Resolve names to IPs  
- 🌐 [DNSDumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com) – Passive DNS recon  

---

### 📌 Skills Demonstrated
- ✅ Understanding the **DNS Protocol** and its role in networking  
- ✅ Exploring the **Domain Hierarchy** (Root > TLD > Subdomain)  
- ✅ Identifying common **Record Types** (A, CNAME, MX, TXT)  
- ✅ Executing **DNS Requests** and interpreting responses  
- ✅ Using OSINT tools to enumerate domain information

---

### 🧠 Practical Examples

```bash
# Lookup A record
dig A tryhackme.com

# Find mail servers (MX record)
dig MX tryhackme.com

# Reverse lookup an IP address
dig -x 10.10.10.10

# nslookup to resolve name
nslookup tryhackme.com

# Subdomain brute-force with DNSDumpster or external tools
  

### 🛠️ Tooling Implementation
```bash
# cURL examples from CTF
curl -X POST -H "User-Agent: CTF-Agent" -d "username=admin" http://target.site/login
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" https://api.ctf.site/data

## 🌐 HTB Academy: Web Requests Module

🎲 **Platform**: [Hack The Box Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/)  
🏅 **Achievement Badge**: [![Badge Link](https://academy.hackthebox.com/images/badges/web-requests.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/achievement/badge/cb163662-43a1-11f0-bcfdbea50ffe6cb4)  
🧠 **Focus Areas**:  
- 🌐 HTTP Protocol & Web Architecture  
- 🔍 Analyzing Web Requests & Responses  
- 🧾 Header & Payload Manipulation  
- 🔄 CRUD Operations with APIs  

🛠️ **Tools Used**:  
- 🧪 `curl` – CLI for crafting HTTP requests  
- 🧰 Browser Developer Tools – Live request inspection  
- 🧮 RESTful API Endpoints – Real-world request testing

---

### 📝 Summary  
**📌 Skills Demonstrated:**  
- GET / POST / PUT / DELETE methods  
- HTTP headers: `User-Agent`, `Content-Type`, `Authorization`  
- API endpoint inspection and interaction  
- HTTP response codes and debugging  
- Secure data handling techniques  

This module deepened my understanding of how web communication works behind the scenes. I gained hands-on experience crafting and intercepting HTTP requests, working with headers, and interacting with REST APIs using both CLI and browser tools. This reinforced my ability to identify insecure endpoints and vulnerabilities in web-based communication.

---

### 🔍 Key Practical Labs

#### 🧪 HTTP Method Mastery  
- Sent test payloads using all core HTTP methods  
- Interpreted 200 / 301 / 403 / 500 response codes  
- Analyzed raw requests using browser DevTools  

#### 🧾 Header Manipulation  
- Modified headers like `User-Agent` and `Authorization`  
- Simulated browser vs bot behavior  
- Sent authenticated API requests with tokens  

#### 🔄 API & CRUD Operations  
- Listed cities via GET  
- Added and removed data via POST/DELETE  
- Verified changes and flag results using PUT  

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- 💡 Gained foundational knowledge in **web traffic structure**  
- 🛠️ Built and tested **custom HTTP requests** with real-world formats  
- 🔍 Practiced identifying **security flaws** in headers and input data  
- 🔐 Learned to safely navigate **web API endpoints**
